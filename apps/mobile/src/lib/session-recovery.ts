/**
 * Where to send someone whose session exists but cannot reach protected
 * resources.
 *
 * `MfaEnrollmentGuard` 403s a *partially authenticated* session in two
 * distinct states, and `/auth/me` is not exempt from it:
 *
 *   - never enrolled (`mfaEnforcementCompletedAt === null`)
 *   - enrolled, but this session has not passed its challenge
 *     (`mfaPending`)
 *
 * Both are recoverable, and neither is "you don't have access". A cold
 * PWA launch straight to `/m/app` carries no memory of how it got there,
 * so without this the user hits a dead end with only a Retry button that
 * will never succeed.
 *
 * Discrimination is by the **stable problem code** the guard emits as an
 * RFC-7807 extension member. An earlier version matched the guard's
 * human-readable message instead, which coupled recovery to server
 * wording — rewording the sentence would have silently reintroduced the
 * dead end. The prose match survives only as a fallback for an API
 * predating the codes, and unrecognised 403s that are not identifiably
 * an authorization denial fall through to `/login`, which re-derives the
 * state authoritatively from the login response.
