 * Mobile's HTTP client.

 * **This deliberately inverts `apps/web/src/lib/api.ts`'s contract.**
 * That one returns `{ ok, status, data, problem }` and never throws for
 * an HTTP failure. Mirroring it here would break TanStack Query
 * silently: Query would treat a 401 or a 500 as a *successful* result,
 * so `retry`, error boundaries, and the cache `onError` handlers would
 * never fire and a dead session would look like an empty list.
 *
 * So: success returns parsed data, non-2xx throws `ApiError`, and an
 * aborted request rethrows unchanged so Query can recognise its own
 * cancellation.
 *
 * The divergence is one-directional. Do NOT "align" `apps/web`'s client
 * to this — it has 96+ call sites depending on the return shape.
