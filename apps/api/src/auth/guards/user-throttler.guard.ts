/**
 * Per-user (falling back to per-IP) rate-limit tracker.
 *
 * Wired in after {@link AuthGuard} in `APP_GUARD` order, so `req.user`
 * has already been resolved by the time `getTracker` runs for
 * authenticated routes. For anonymous traffic (`/login`, `/signup`,
 * public probes, health) we fall back to the client IP — which is
 * the real client once {@link main.ts} has `trust proxy` set and the
 * web SSR layer forwards `x-forwarded-for`.
 *
 * The previous behaviour was "IP only, bucketed against Express's
 * raw socket peer". In Docker that meant every authenticated SSR
 * call from every operator shared a single global bucket keyed on
 * the web container's internal bridge address — a single user
 * refreshing a company page could exhaust the 100-req/min quota in
 * one action. Keying on user id gives each signed-in operator their
 * own isolated budget, so concurrent users don't starve each other.
 *
 * We intentionally keep the `global` throttler name; only the
 * identity it hashes into changes. That way the Redis key space
 * stays layer-compatible with existing deployments — old keys just
 * age out of their 60s TTL naturally.
 *
 * Rejections additionally emit a `security.ratelimit.blocked` audit
 * row (coalesced to one per limiter+key per block window) that feeds
 * the "IP blocked or rate limited" security alert. This is pure
 * observation: the 429, its message, and the Retry-After header are
 * byte-identical to the stock guard — `handleRequest` sets the header
 * before `throwThrottlingException` runs, and our override ends by
 * delegating to `super`.
