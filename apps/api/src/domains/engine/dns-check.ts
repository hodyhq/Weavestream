/**
 * DNS checks — A, AAAA, MX, and NS records resolved in parallel.
 *
 * Each sub-query has its own timeout so a single slow record type
 * can't starve the others. A record that returns `NODATA` (e.g. a
 * domain that legitimately has no AAAA) resolves to an empty array
 * rather than throwing — only a *resolver* error becomes a failure.
 *
 * We classify the aggregate as:
 *   OK   — at least one A or AAAA, and NS records present
 *   WARN — missing A/AAAA *or* missing NS (typo vs parking page)
 *   FAIL — every sub-query errored
