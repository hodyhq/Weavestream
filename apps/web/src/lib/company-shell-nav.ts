 * Header navigation targets for `CompanyShell`, by viewer and mode.
 *
 * Extracted from the component so the one invariant that matters here
 * is testable rather than asserted by reading:
 *
 *   **A viewer without admin-shell access is never handed an `/admin`
 *   href.** Every route out of the portal for such a user is either a
 *   `/portal/**` link or `/`, which itself re-derives the landing
 *   route from the session and only reaches `/admin` for viewers who
 *   pass the same `canAccessAdminShell` check.
 *
 * Shape by viewer:
 *   admin mode          — one block, the workspace identity → `/admin`.
 *   client, any tenants — the mark is static. A client has nowhere to
 *                         go: `/` only re-derives their landing route
 *                         and, via the `ws_last_company` cookie, drops
 *                         them in the tenant they are already in. With
 *                         2+ tenants the switcher popover is the one
 *                         control that does anything; with 1 there is
 *                         nothing to switch to.
 *   operator previewing — mark → `/admin`, title → `/admin/companies`,
 *                         their real switcher. An operator who also
 *                         holds 2+ memberships gets the popover
 *                         instead, since that switches without leaving
 *                         the portal.
