/**
 * Resolves the portal company for a given slug. Membership rows are
 * the fast path; admins (SUPER_ADMIN or OPERATORs with non-NONE
 * `globalAccess` / platform capabilities — i.e. `canAccessAdminShell`)
 * fall through to the `/companies` list endpoint so they can preview
 * the portal without holding an explicit membership.
 *
 * Authorization is enforced at the API tier: `/companies?q=` filters
 * server-side to the rows the actor is allowed to read (memberships +
 * RBAC v2 global access), so a non-admin or an operator with
 * `globalAccess=NONE` who isn't a member of the target company gets an
 * empty list and falls through to `notFound()`. Every downstream
 * per-company data call (`listPasswords`, `getAsset`, …) re-enforces
 * its own permission at the controller layer, so this helper is *not*
 * the security boundary — it is a UX shortcut.
 *
 * Calls `notFound()` if no matching company is accessible to the user.

  // *development* reconciler via `performance.measure(name, { start,
  // end, detail })`. WebKit rejects that call for an aborted render and
  // raises a bare `TypeError` ("Type error" at `measure [native
  // code]`), which pops the Next.js dev error overlay even though the
  // 404 renders fine. The instrumentation is stripped from the
  // production React build (zero prod impact) and doesn't reproduce in
  // Chromium. Revisit only if Next bundles a React that guards the call.
