Weavestream is a self-hosted platform for managing IT operations knowledge.

Assets, passwords, domains, IP networks, vendors, contacts, procedures, and documentation live in a connected system instead of isolated records.

Built for MSPs, internal IT teams, and homelabs, Weavestream helps you understand not just what you have, but how everything relates.

## Documentation with Context

Most documentation systems store information as pages.

Weavestream stores relationships.

A firewall can be linked to:
- its credentials
- public IPs
- domains
- SSL certificates
- ISP information
- support contacts
- procedures
- related assets

The result is documentation that behaves like a connected system instead of a collection of notes.

## Why Weavestream?

- **Connected documentation.** Assets, credentials, domains, vendors, contacts, and procedures are linked together so context is never lost.
- **Built for IT operations.** Designed for MSPs, internal IT teams, and homelabs—not generic note-taking.
- **Self-hosted and open source.** Your data stays under your control.
- **Modern and extensible.** Docker-first deployment, OpenAI-compatible AI integrations, and a growing ecosystem of integrations.

## Highlights

- **Connected documentation.** Markdown and rich-text articles, folders, photo
  galleries, and configurable asset layouts per organization.
- **Password management.** AES-256-GCM encrypted credential storage with
  TOTP support, breach detection, and role-based access control.
- **IP Address Management (IPAM).** Manage IPv4 subnets, track utilization,
  detect conflicts with asset IP fields, and expose network data to clients.
- **Domain & SSL monitoring.** WHOIS expiry, DNS health, and TLS certificate
  validity checks with aggregated expiration dashboards.
- **Expiration tracking.** Monitor asset expiration dates (licenses,
  warranties, SSL certificates, passwords) with visibility into upcoming renewals.
- **AI Chat.** Ask questions, draft documentation, and edit articles directly from a persistent chat panel. Powered by any OpenAI-compatible LLM you configure.
- **Alert system.** Email notifications for expirations, website downtime,
  and record lifecycle events with flexible scheduling.
- **Security Center.** Admin dashboard for login activity, active sessions,
  lockouts, rate-limit blocks, and egress attempt monitoring.
- **Integrations.** Sync inventory from external platforms (Action1, NinjaOne, UniFi, Breeze, Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, Level)
  into tenant asset records on demand or on a schedule.
- **Invite-only user management** with per-user setup tokens, forced
  TOTP MFA, IP-based access rules, and append-only audit logging.
- **Two-layer RBAC.** Global roles combined with per-tenant memberships
  evaluated from a single permission matrix.
- **Customer portals.** Each tenant gets a read-only portal where client
  users see only the articles, assets, passwords, and domains their role allows.
- **Local file storage.** Tenant files live on a shared host-mounted
  filesystem path with per-tenant directory isolation.
- **Docker-first.** Three containers (`api`, `web`, `worker`) plus
  Postgres and Redis. Pulled, not built.

See the [architecture docs](https://docs.weavestream.io/overview/architecture/) for the topology,
RBAC model, storage layout, terminology system, and repo layout.

## Quickstart

```bash
# Grab the compose file and env template
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Weavestream/Weavestream/main/compose.yml
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Weavestream/Weavestream/main/.env.example
mv .env.example .env

# Generate random keys (macOS/Linux/WSL)
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Weavestream/Weavestream/main/scripts/keygen.sh | bash >> .env

# Start everything
docker compose up -d

# Create the first admin
docker compose exec api node dist/cli.js create-admin
```

Open <http://localhost:3000/login> and sign in. On Windows, use
[`scripts/keygen.ps1`](scripts/keygen.ps1) instead.

repeatable. See the
[releases page](https://github.com/Weavestream/Weavestream/releases) and
[changelog](https://docs.weavestream.io/overview/changelog/) for published
images, upgrade notes, and release history.
