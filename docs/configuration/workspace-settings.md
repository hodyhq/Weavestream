# Workspace Settings

Workspace settings are managed from **Admin → Settings** by a `SUPER_ADMIN`. These settings control the name and vocabulary used throughout the UI — no code changes or container restarts are required.

The values are stored in a singleton `system_settings` row. They affect UI copy only; they do not rename routes, API paths, database columns, or RBAC keys.

## Workspace Name

The **workspace name** appears in the top-left sidebar chip on every admin page. Set it to your organisation's name, product name, or however you want the platform identified to your users.

**Examples:** `Acme IT`, `Helpdesk`, `InfraBase`, `MyMSP`

## Workspace Subtitle

A short **subtitle** appears as muted text below the workspace name in the sidebar. This is typically a descriptor like `workspace`, `documentation`, or `IT portal`.

## Tenant Terminology

The word used for "tenant" everywhere in the UI is configurable. This is the term used in:

- Sidebar navigation labels
- Button and dialog titles
- Breadcrumbs and page headings
- Empty state messages
- Help text

### Presets

| Preset | Singular | Plural | Possessive |
|---|---|---|---|
| Company | Company | Companies | Company's |
| Client | Client | Clients | Client's |
| Department | Department | Departments | Department's |
| Tenant | Tenant | Tenants | Tenant's |
| Organisation | Organisation | Organisations | Organisation's |
| Site | Site | Sites | Site's |
| Custom | (your term) | (your plural) | (your possessive) |

The **Custom** option lets you enter any term for singular, plural, and possessive forms independently.

## Stored Settings

| Setting | Shown in | Default |
|---|---|---|
| Workspace name | Sidebar chip at the top of every admin page | `My Company` |
| Workspace subtitle | Muted text below the workspace name | `workspace` |
| Tenant term, singular | Buttons, dialog titles, help text, empty states | `Company` |
| Tenant term, plural | Sidebar navigation, breadcrumbs, column headers, page titles | `Companies` |
| Tenant term, possessive | Phrases such as "this client's assets" | `Company's` |

### Live Preview

The settings page includes a **live preview** that updates in real time as you type. The preview shows:

- The sidebar navigation with your term applied
- Example dialog titles ("New [Client]", "Edit [Client]")
- Empty state copy ("No [clients] yet")

This lets you see exactly how the UI will look before saving.

## Password Generator Defaults

Workspace-wide defaults for the [password generator](/features/passwords/#password-generator):

| Setting | Description |
|---|---|
| Default mode | Words + symbols, Passphrase, or Custom length |
| Minimum length | Minimum characters (for custom length mode) |
| Word separator | Character used between words in passphrase mode |

These defaults are used when the generator is opened without user-specific preferences. Users can override them per-session.

## Integration OAuth Apps

**Admin > Settings > Integrations** holds the OAuth app (client) that OAuth-based integrations connect through. You create the client once per Weavestream install in the provider's console (for example the Google Cloud console), then every integration of that provider uses it. Each customer connection is then one click: **Connect with Google** on the integration's Credentials tab.

The card shows:

| Item | What to do with it |
|---|---|
| Authorized redirect URI | Register it on the OAuth client exactly as shown. It is built from `API_URL` (`<API_URL>/v1/admin/integrations/oauth/callback`), so `API_URL` must be the public URL browsers use. |
| Scopes | Add them to the consent screen. The list is the union of what the available integrations of that provider request. |
| Client ID / Client secret | Paste them from the provider and save. |

The client secret is write-only: it is stored AES-256-GCM encrypted under `INTEGRATION_SECRET_KEY` and never shown again. The card shows a short SHA-256 fingerprint so you can tell which secret is saved. To change only the client ID, leave the secret blank and the saved secret is kept (enter the new client's secret too if it differs). Saving needs the **Settings** permission and a fresh step-up confirmation, and is recorded in the audit log as `settings.integration_oauth_app.update`.

Connecting, reconnecting and disconnecting an integration are recorded as `integration.oauth.connect`, `integration.oauth.connect.failed` (with a reason category, never the provider's error text) and `integration.oauth.disconnect`.

## What Settings Don't Change

Workspace settings are **cosmetic only**. The following always remain as-is regardless of configuration:

- URL paths (`/admin/companies/...` — not `/admin/clients/...`)
- API endpoints (`/api/companies/...`)
- Database column names (`companyId`)
- Log messages and audit log entries

This means you can change terminology at any time without breaking bookmarks, integrations, or audit history.
